# elm-kitten

![build status](https://github.com/n1k0/elm-kitten/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)

This project has been forken from [elm kitchen](https://github.com/allo-media/elm-kitten), which has been unmaintained for more than a year now.

> This is a modest attempt at providing a simplistic yet opinionated Elm [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) application skeleton based on rtfeldman's [Elm Example SPA](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example/), for [Allo-Media](http://tech.allo-media.net/)'s own needs.

[Check for yourself](https://n1k0.github.io/elm-kitten/)

## Features

- Elm 0.19 ready
- Multiple pages navigation & routing, based on URL fragments
- Live development server with hot reloading
- [elm-test](https://github.com/elm-community/elm-test) support
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) support
- JavaScript build minification using UglifyJS.

## Code organization

The application stores Elm source code in the `src` directory:

```
$ tree --dirsfirst skeleton/src
src
├── Data
│   └── Session.elm
├── Page
│   ├── Home.elm
│   └── SecondPage.elm
├── Request
│   └── Github.elm
├── Views
│   ├── Page.elm
│   └── Theme.elm
├── Main.elm
└── Route.elm
```

Richard Feldman explains this organization in a [dedicated blog post](https://dev.to/rtfeldman/tour-of-an-open-source-elm-spa).
